:: My Gentoo auto-configurator script. Meant to be run from within a VirtualBox VM running Archlinux's live CD.

:: Results in:
-- Two partitions: /boot and /root
-- EFI boot partition
-- Root partition is LUKS encrypted
-- systemd-boot
-- No swap
-- Auto-login for daily user
-- Passwordless DOAS for daily user

:: Instructions
:: Run the following command from within Archlinux's live CD environment to install the base system:

bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulTOliver/gen-orbit/master/setup-livecd.sh)

:: After reboot and login, run the following to setup user environment:

bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulTOliver/gen-orbit/master/setup-user.sh)

:: Notes:
-- This script is meant for experimentation only. Ideally you will want to do these steps manually when installing on
-- hardware, given Gentoo's (ehem) sensitivity to fuck-ups.
